How to Install Kloxo on RHEL or CentOS VPS

 

The Kloxo installation process differs depending on whether you have already setup MySQL. If you have already 
installed MySQL and set a root password, skip to the second set of steps. Otherwise, proceed below. You will need to
be logged in to your VPS as the root user to install Kloxo.
 
# yum install -y wget
# wget http://download.lxcenter.org/download/kloxo/production/kloxo-installer.sh
# sh ./kloxo-installer.sh --type=master
 
 
If MySQL is already installed with a root password set:
 
# yum install -y wget
# wget http://download.lxcenter.org/download/kloxo/production/kloxo-installer.sh
# sh ./kloxo-installer.sh --type= --db-rootpassword=PASSWORD
 
 
Once setup is complete, you can configure Kloxo at: http://xx.xx.xx.xx:7778 
(Login with username: admin and password: admin)
