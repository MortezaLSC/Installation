Install cPanel
Although the cPanel installation only has several steps, the installation does take a long time. Although using
program "screen" is not necessary in order to install cPanel, it can be a very helpful addition to the installation
process. It can be especially useful if you know that you may have issues with intermittent internet or that you will
need to pause the lengthy install process. To start off, go ahead and install screen:
sudo yum install screen

Once screen is installed, start a new session running:
screen

After opening screen, you can proceed to install cPanel with WHM or a DNS only version of cPanel.
Use this this command to install cPanel with WHM:
wget -N http://httpupdate.cPanel.net/latest

Use this command to install the DNS only version of cPanel:
wget -N http://httpupdate.cPanel.net/latest-dnsonly

With the requested package downloaded, we can go ahead and start the script running:
sh latest

Then close out of screen. The script, which may take one to two hours to complete will continue running while
in the backgroundâ€”even if you close out the of server. In order to detach screen type: Cntrl-a-d To reattach to
your screen you can use the command:
screen -r

Once cPanel finally installs, you can access the login by going to your ip address:2087 (eg. 12.34.45.678:2087l) or
domain (example.com:2087) Your login will be:
username: your_server_user
password: your_password

From there, you can create your cpanel user and finally login in at ipaddress/cpanel or domain/cpanel
