At first you should install python 2.7 or 3.3 on CentOS 6:
CentOS 6.2 and 6.3 ships with Python 2.6.6. You can manually install Python 2.7 and Python 3.3 but you must be careful
to leave the system version alone. Several critical utilities, for example yum, depend on Python 2.6.6 and if you 
replace it bad things will happen.

Below are the steps necessary to install Python 2.7.3 and Python 3.3.0 without touching the system version of Python. 
The procedure is exactly the same for both versions except for the filenames. People have reported that this also works
for CentOS 5.8 but I havenâ€™t tested that. Execute all the commands below as root either by logging in as root or by 
using sudo.

Install development tools:
In order to compile Python you must first install the development tools and a few extra libs. The extra libs are not 
strictly needed to compile Python but without them your new Python interpreter will be quite useless.
# yum groupinstall "Development tools"
# yum install zlib-devel bzip2-devel openssl-devel ncurses-devel sqlite-devel readline-devel tk-devel


Download and install Python:
It is critical that you use make altinstall below. If you use make install you will end up with two different versions
of Python in the filesystem both named python. This can lead to problems that are very hard to diagnose.


Download and install Python 2.7.3:
# wget http://python.org/ftp/python/2.7.3/Python-2.7.3.tar.bz2
# tar xf Python-2.7.3.tar.bz2
# cd Python-2.7.3
# ./configure --prefix=/usr/local
# make && make altinstall

OR:

Download and install Python 3.3.0:
# wget http://python.org/ftp/python/3.3.0/Python-3.3.0.tar.bz2
# tar xf Python-3.3.0.tar.bz2
# cd Python-3.3.0 
# ./configure --prefix=/usr/local
# make && make altinstall

After running the commands above your newly installed Python interpreter will be available as /usr/local/bin/python2.7
or /usr/local/bin/python3.3. The system version of Python 2.6.6 will continue to be available as /usr/bin/python 
and /usr/bin/python2.6.

After that you run the "dns-finder.py" and see there is a problem with module "netaddr". So:
#yum install python-netaddr.noarch

After that you run the "dns-finder.py" and see there is another problem with module "dnspython". So:
#wget http://www.dnspython.org/kits/1.9.2/dnspython-1.9.2.tar.gz
#tar -xzvf dnspython-1.9.2.tar.gz
#cd dnspython-1.9.2
#export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/home/manoj/python/lib:/usr/local/curl-7.19.7/lib:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH
#export PATH=/home/manoj/python/bin:$PATH
#python setup.py install

Now your script is ready for running :)
