What is pcalc?
PCalc is the ULTIMATE programmers calculator. A must for anyone who develops algorithms or uses C / C++ on a regular
basis.
If you're a programmer, you've probably downloaded a so-called 'programmers calculator' at least once in your life,
only to be sorely disappointed; I'm sorry, but displaying the results in hex and/or binary doesn't make a calculator
a 'programmers calculator', nor does making 42 a constant in it either.
Programmers around the world, your prayers have been answered - Behold AnalogX PCalc, the ULTIMATE programmers 
calculator. Forget putting up lame buttons with numbers on them; that's fine in the real world, but hardly useful in 
a GUI, let's instead focus on functionality, and that's just what I did.
AnalogX PCalc allows you to enter any equation in the EXACT same format as C / C++, and it will process it with the 
same precedence, giving you the results in a variety of formats!...

Istalling:
To install libdate-pcalc-perl just follow these instructions.
Check the universe repository is enabled.

Inspect /etc/apt/sources.list using your favourite editor with sudo which will ensure that you have the correct 
permissions.
$sudo emacs -nw /etc/apt/sources.list
Ensure that universe is included.

After any changes you should run this command to update your system.
$sudo apt-get update

Install libdate-pcalc-perl:
$sudo apt-get install libdate-pcalc-perl


After that you should download it from http://sourceforge.net/projects/pcalc/files/:
I chose the "pcalc-2.tar.lzma" (last version on Sunday, 5 January 2014)


After that I faced a problem aboul -lfl so it related to libfl.so

I did:

$sudo apt-get install apt-file
$sudo apt-file update
$sudo apt-get install libfl-dev

after that I compiled it:
$cc pcalc.o pcalcl.o funct.o math.o symbol.o help.o store.o print.o str.o convert.o  -lm -lfl -o pcalc


Then :In the pcalc directory "pcalc" script appeared
I copied it into /usr/bin

so I have:
$pcalc x10 + 4
	4               	0x4               	0y100
