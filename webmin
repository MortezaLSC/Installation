Overview
This tutorial will walk you through the installation of Webmin 1.470 on an Ubuntu 12.04 LTS (Precise Pangolin) server.
This tutorial assumes you are working on a brand new server with nothing else installed.

Note: You must be logged in as root or a user with sudo access to perform this installation.


Install Pre-Requisites
Prior to installing Webmin we need to install a few pre-requisites. Type the following command below to install the
required modules:

# sudo apt-get install libnet-ssleay-perl libauthen-pam-perl libio-pty-perl apt-show-versions libapt-pkg-perl -y

Install Webmin
Before you can install Webmin you will need to download the latest copy. Point your web browser
to http://www.webmin.com/download.html. Scroll down the list of versions and find the one that is called Debian 
package suitable for Debian, Ubuntu or other derived Linux. Copy that link to your clipboard.

On the server we will use wget to download Webmin. Type the following on your server to download:
cd /root
wget http://prdownloads.sourceforge.net/webadmin/webmin_1.630_all.deb

Note: Your URL may be different as new versions of the webmin application are released


Installation
Now it is time to install the Webmin package. To do so, use the command below:

dpkg -i webmin_1.630_all.deb

Note: Your version number may be different as new versions of the webmin application are released.

Once the installation has completed you should get the following message:

 
Webmin install complete. You can now login to https://12.34.56.78:10000/
as root with your root password, or as any user who can use sudo
to run commands as root.

Logging In
You are now ready to log into your Webmin console. To do this point your web browser to 
https://12.34.56.78:10000/ where you will be prompted with a login screen (be sure to change 12.34.56.78 to your 
server's IP). On your first login use the username root and type in your root password.
