Overview
This tutorial will walk you through the installation of Webmin 1.470 on an Ubuntu 12.04 LTS (Precise Pangolin) server.
This tutorial assumes you are working on a brand new server with nothing else installed.

Note: You must be logged in as root or a user with sudo access to perform this installation.


Install Pre-Requisites
Prior to installing Webmin we need to install a few pre-requisites. Type the following command below to install the
required modules:

# sudo apt-get install libnet-ssleay-perl libauthen-pam-perl libio-pty-perl apt-show-versions libapt-pkg-perl -y

Install Webmin
Before you can install Webmin you will need to download the latest copy. Point your web browser
to http://www.webmin.com/download.html. Scroll down the list of versions and find the one that is called Debian 
package suitable for Debian, Ubuntu or other derived Linux. Copy that link to your clipboard.

On the server we will use wget to download Webmin. Type the following on your server to download:
cd /root
wget http://prdownloads.sourceforge.net/webadmin/webmin_1.630_all.deb

Note: Your URL may be different as new versions of the webmin application are released


Installation
Now it is time to install the Webmin package. To do so, use the command below:

dpkg -i webmin_1.630_all.deb

Note: Your version number may be different as new versions of the webmin application are released.

Once the installation has completed you should get the following message:

 
Webmin install complete. You can now login to https://12.34.56.78:10000/
as root with your root password, or as any user who can use sudo
to run commands as root.

Logging In
You are now ready to log into your Webmin console. To do this point your web browser to 
https://12.34.56.78:10000/ where you will be prompted with a login screen (be sure to change 12.34.56.78 to your 
server's IP). On your first login use the username root and type in your root password.

If you are using the DEB version of webmin, first download the file from the downloads page , or run the command :
wget http://prdownloads.sourceforge.net/webadmin/webmin_1.670_all.deb

then run the command :
dpkg --install webmin_1.670_all.deb

The install will be done automatically to /usr/share/webmin, the administration username set to root and the
password to your current root password. You should now be able to login to Webmin at the 
URL http://localhost:10000/. Or if accessing it remotely, replace localhost with your system's IP address.

If Debian complains about missing dependencies, you can install them with the command :
apt-get install perl libnet-ssleay-perl openssl libauthen-pam-perl libpam-runtime libio-pty-perl apt-show-versionspython

If you are installing on Ubuntu and the apt-get command reports that some of the packages cannot be found,
edit /etc/apt/sources.list and make sure the lines ending with universe are not commented out.
Some Debian-based distributions (Ubuntu in particular) don't allow logins by the root user by default
However, the user created at system installation time can use sudo to switch to root. Webmin will allow any user
who has this sudo capability to login with full root privileges.
If you want to connect from a remote server and your system has a firewall installed, see this page for 
instructions on how to open up port 10000.
Using the Webmin APT repository
If you like to install and update Webmin via APT, edit the /etc/apt/sources.list file on your system and add 
the lines :
deb http://download.webmin.com/download/repository sarge contrib
deb http://webmin.mirror.somersettechsolutions.co.uk/repository sarge contrib
You should also fetch and install my GPG key with which the repository is signed, with the commands :
cd /root
wget http://www.webmin.com/jcameron-key.asc
apt-key add jcameron-key.asc

You will now be able to install with the commands :
apt-get update
apt-get install webmin

All dependencies should be resolved automatically.
Supported Debian-based Distributions
Webmin has been tested on all regular Debian releases, Ubuntu Linux, and derivatives like Xandros and APLINUX.
