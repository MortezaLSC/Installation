First, the Plesk Debian repository should be added to the sources list. The link to the Plesk Debian repository is:
http://autoinstall.plesk.com/.

Open it in a web browser to see which Plesk versions are available.
Then add the repository record for your desired Plesk version into "/etc/apt/sources.list." For example, you would
use the below line for 
Plesk 11.0.9 Etch:
deb http://autoinstall.plesk.com/PSA_11.0.9/ etch all

Next, update the cache packages list:
apt-get update

apt-get install psa

user: admin
